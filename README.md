Hi there :)

I’m a motivated IT specialist apprentice for application development, currently gaining practical experience at CHECK24. I’m working on PHP applications and relational databases (SQL), contributing to software projects, optimizing queries, and helping implement new features.

I’m especially interested in structured database design, and practical software development. I’m open to knowledge exchange, mentoring, and collaborative projects in Leipzig or remotely.

Focus areas: PHP, SQL, database management, application development
Current position: Apprentice at CHECK24 (Felix-Bloch School), Leipzig
Education: IT Specialist in Application Development (2025–2028)
